Backstory: 

A few months after I moved in Stockholm I decided to support the Stockholm Apache Kafka Meetup (SAK).
So to kick of the 2021 season, I gave a talk about a tutorial I have created a few months ago on 
[https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io](https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io). 

Tutorial:

[Emit a final result from a time window](https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/window-final-result/kstreams.html)

The abstract:
> When processing event-streams, time-based operations are not the easiest to reflect on. However, they are essential! Many classic operations, such as grouping elements over a window or joining two streams are, by default, expected from a stream processing libraries like Kafka Stream. Among those features, emitting a final result at the end of a window has been for a long time impossible. So what is different with this operation? And what are the great powers you will unlock by using it in your application? Let's refer to kafka-tutorials to answer those questions. As a warm-up for a year full of great Kafka meetups, this talk walks you through a particular Kafka tutorial. You will get a very concrete implementation of that classic exercise. It will discuss the concept that makes this final window result possible, and finally, you will have an overview of how kafka-tutorials works and how to contribute to it.
