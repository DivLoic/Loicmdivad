Hello, again... I've decided to relaunch this site. People always insist on the importance of having some sort of
online presence. Specially for developers and blogging. So here is mine! Itâ€™s not totally new. 
Iâ€™ve revamped my previous attempt to create a personal page by migrating to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
Hugo is a powerful and famous static site generator. I've been using other types of tools previously.

|Year            | Tech                     |
|:--------------:|--------------------------| 
|2014            | Self hosted Wordpress    |
|2015            | Angular + Divhost        |
|2016            | Ember + Firebase         |
|2020 (now)      | Hugo + Github Pages      |

The primary objective of this site is to publish short notes. Little blog posts that address simple subjects. 
It also aims to gather links to longer posts published on other blogs (e.g. 
[blog.xebia.fr](https://blog.xebia.fr/author/ldivad/), [medium.com/xebia-france](https://medium.com/xebia-france)).
There is also a page dedicated to [talks](/talks/) I gave. Finally, to do exactly like everyone else Iâ€™ve got my 
self a place to brag ðŸ‘‰ [about](/about/). 

{{< repost

    title="An example of link pointing at other blogging platform" >}}

Now what to expect from this? Not much, actually. I've planned to add notes about `Scala`, 
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and Google Cloud Tips. And now if you've randomly got here, and wonder: _"how 
it is different from the tons of programming blogs I already know"_... it is not! All you should expect is a 
*lolo*-version of all the things you've already seen out there!

Happy reading! ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
