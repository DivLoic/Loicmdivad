Software Engineers frequently engage themself into new learning paths. We keep learning skills related to our field such as programming languages; libraries or even how new data systems work. This idea is one of the 4 company values of [@PubSapientEng](https://twitter.com/PubSapientEng), and they named it: Sharing Knowledge. Why "sharing"? Besides the idea to keep up with tech, it's a good way to extends your skills and get new perspectives on the job you do every day. When structuring what you have learnt, enough to share it (e.g. a blog post, a tech conferences, podcast), you will consolidate your new skills and confront your understanding to others. This is mainly why, in early 2017, I've started to dig in what is [Apache Kudu](https://kudu.apache.org/). At that time, I was focused on NoSQL technologies, Hadoop platforms and huge batch ingestions.

At the same time, I was preparing my very first technical talk. Can you guess the title of the presentation?? Exactly: [Apache Kudu: the new big data antelope](/talks/apache-kudu-the-new-big-data-antelope/). Recycling is also an essential rule in this Sharing Knowledge thing. Not everyone consumes content the same way, but by switching format for the same subject, you will talk to a bigger audience and develop more skills. 

For consulting companies, it is essential. It solves two significant problems:

- They need extra motivation to keep their teams learning
- They need the people outside to know they exist and they are interested in cool stuff

That's why Sharing Knowledge is a win-win.
