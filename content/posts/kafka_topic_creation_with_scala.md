If you develop a piece of software dealing with data systems, you are probably facing a few prerequisites. 
For example, you may need a file system to be set up or a database table to be created. 
The same applies to event stream applications using [**Apache Kafka**](http://kafka.apache.org/)Â® as an event log. 
They need **topics**, **schemas** and **ACLs** to be created to be able to run correctly. 
However, these tasks aren't the applications responsibility. 
It would be terrible to include these creation tasks as part of our main class or program entry-point. 
Does that mean we have to leave to the operators or the people managing the Kafka cluster ðŸ¤”?
  
This short post will explore the `AdminClient` class and give an example of creation tasks in scala.
All the code will be Scala 2.13.1; the post is based on the version 2.4.0 of Kafka and 5.3.2 of the Confluent Platform.
  
### The `NewTopic` class, our topic definition First of all, we have to define the needed topics.   
  
In the main class where all our tasks will   
  
```scala  
object TopicCreation extends App {  

 val newTopics = Verctor(
	 new NewTopic("ACCOUNT-TOPIC", 8, 1),    
	 new NewTopic("CLICK-TOPIC", 32, 1),   
	 new NewTopic("OUTPUT-TOPIC", 16, 1)  
 )}  
```
