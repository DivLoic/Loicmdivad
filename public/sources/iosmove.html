  Work with optional value is sometimes pain full. Every Java developer had to face the NPE issue
  <i>(NullPointerException)</i>. While some programme
<pre><code class="java">String version = "0.1";
if(foo != null){
  FooBar bar = foo.getBar();
  if(bar != null){
    String v = bar.getVersion;
    if(v != null){
      version = v;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
  Other programming languages, like Scala, Julia or Haskel introduice Optional types.
  This just a type of object that can either a value or nothing. it has easy access that allow to gently unwrap it

<pre><code class="swift">if let version = foo?.getBar?.getVersion {
    print("the latets version of lolo is: \(v)")
}</code></pre>

</div>
